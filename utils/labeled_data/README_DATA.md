Datasets of known orientations and trajectories were collected. Here is an overview of the labeled datasets and what they represent:

<strong> rotate_x_axis_90deg.csv:</strong> A 90° rotation around the x-axis<br/>
<strong> rotate_y_axis_90deg.csv:</strong> A 90° rotation around the y-axis<br/>
<strong> rotate_z_axis_90deg.csv:</strong> A 90° rotation around the z-axis<br/>
<strong> rotate_x_axis_360deg.csv:</strong> A 360° rotation around the x-axis<br/>
<strong> rotate_y_axis_90deg_stop.csv:</strong> A 90° rotation around the y-axis, with a stationary period during the orientation <br/>
<strong> spiral_1_loop.csv:</strong> Walking upwards for the first loop of the spiral <br/>
<strong> spiral_2_loop.csv:</strong> Walking upwards for the first two loops of the spiral <br/>
<strong> spiral_stops_loop.csv:</strong> Walking up the whole spiral, with stops at the chemistry lab, teachers room and electronics lab <br/>
<strong> spiral_loop_backwards_section.csv:</strong> Walking up the whole spiral and then walking down for one loop of the spiral, ending at the electronics lab <br/>
