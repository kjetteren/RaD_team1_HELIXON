Datasets of known  trajectories were collected. Here is an overview of the labeled datasets (for the x,y,z positions) and what they represent:

<strong> spiral_1_loop.csv:</strong> Walking upwards for the first loop of the spiral <br/>
<strong> spiral_2_loop.csv:</strong> Walking upwards for the first two loops of the spiral <br/>
<strong> spiral_stops_loop.csv:</strong> Walking up the whole spiral, with stops at the chemistry lab, teachers room and electronics lab <br/>
<strong> spiral_loop_backwards_section.csv:</strong> Walking up the whole spiral and then walking down for one loop of the spiral, ending at the electronics lab <br/>
