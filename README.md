# Research & Development Team 1 HELIXON Challenge Repository
This is the repository of the Research & Development Team 1 for the HELIXON Challenge

### What has been done?

##### Wiktoria
- research on classic filtering methods in the position estimation problem => focus on Kalman filters (Savitsky-Goley filters are too slow, not suitable for real time)
- Kalman filter implementation in MATLAB (failed)
- Kalman filter implementation in python (somewhat 'successful')
- Bingham filter implementation in C (ongoing)
- initial research on Extended Kalman filter implementation (very shallow)


### What is to be done?

- [ ] implement Extended Kalman filter
- [ ] look into Unscented Kalman filter

- [ ] write paper
- [ ] make final presentation
